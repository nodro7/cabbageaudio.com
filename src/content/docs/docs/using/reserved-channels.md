Cabbage 3 will initialise a set of named Csound channels when it first loads. Some provide system-specific directory paths, while others convey environmental or system information, such as window dimensions or plugin status. These channels provide a cross-platform way to access common system directories or runtime data without hardcoding values. Cabbage 3 works with absolute file paths, so be sure to derive all file paths from known locations where appropriate.

## CSD and Plugin Information

### `CSD_PATH`
The directory path where the current CSD file is located. Useful for loading resources relative to your CSD file location.

### `IS_A_PLUGIN`
Returns 1 if the instrument is running inside a DAW, otherwise returns 0. 

### `IS_ARA_PLUGIN`
Returns 1 if the instrument has support for ARA. 

## Host Transport

### `HOST_BPM`
The host transport tempo in beats per minute.

### `HOST_IS_PLAYING`
Returns 1 while the host transport is playing, otherwise returns 0.

### `HOST_IS_RECORDING`
Returns 1 while the host transport is recording, otherwise returns 0.

### `HOST_TIME_IN_SECONDS`
The host transport position in seconds.

### `HOST_TIME_IN_SAMPLES`
The host transport position in samples, calculated from the position in seconds and the current sample rate.

### `HOST_TIME_SIG_NUM`
The numerator of the host transport time signature.

### `HOST_TIME_SIG_DENOM`
The denominator of the host transport time signature.

### `HOST_PPQ_POS`
The host transport position in pulses per quarter note (PPQ), reported at the start of the current bar.

## User Directories

### `USER_HOME_DIRECTORY`
The user's home directory. On Windows, this is typically `C:\Users\<username>`. On macOS and Linux, this is `/Users/<username>` or `/home/<username>` respectively.

### `USER_DOCUMENTS_DIRECTORY`
The user's Documents folder. On Windows, this is `C:\Users\<username>\Documents`. On macOS, this is `/Users/<username>/Documents`. On Linux, this defaults to the home directory since Linux doesn't have a standard Documents folder.

### `USER_DESKTOP_DIRECTORY`
The user's Desktop folder. On Windows, this is `C:\Users\<username>\Desktop`. On macOS, this is `/Users/<username>/Desktop`. On Linux, this is `/home/<username>/Desktop`.

### `USER_MUSIC_DIRECTORY`
The user's Music folder. On Windows, this is `C:\Users\<username>\Music`. On macOS, this is `/Users/<username>/Music`. On Linux, this is `/home/<username>/Music`.

### `USER_MOVIES_DIRECTORY`
The user's Movies/Videos folder. On Windows, this is `C:\Users\<username>\Videos`. On macOS, this is `/Users/<username>/Movies`. On Linux, this is `/home/<username>/Videos`.

### `USER_PICTURES_DIRECTORY`
The user's Pictures folder. On Windows, this is `C:\Users\<username>\Pictures`. On macOS, this is `/Users/<username>/Pictures`. On Linux, this is `/home/<username>/Pictures`.

### `USER_APPLICATION_DATA_DIRECTORY`
The user's application data directory for storing application-specific data. On Windows, this is `C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Local`. On macOS, this is `/Users/<username>/Library/Application Support`. On Linux, this is `/home/<username>/.config`.

## System Directories

### `COMMON_APPLICATION_DATA_DIRECTORY`
The system-wide application data directory for shared application data. On Windows, this is `C:\ProgramData`. On macOS, this is `/Library/Application Support`. On Linux, this is `/opt`.

### `COMMON_DOCUMENTS_DIRECTORY`
The system-wide shared documents directory. On Windows, this is `C:\Users\Public\Documents`. On macOS, this is `/Users/Shared`. On Linux, this is `/usr/share`.

### `WINDOWS_SYSTEM_DIRECTORY`
The Windows system directory. On Windows, this is `C:\Windows\System32`. Not applicable on macOS and Linux (returns empty string).

### `GLOBAL_APPLICATIONS_DIRECTORY`
The system-wide applications directory. On Windows, this is `C:\Program Files`. On macOS, this is `/Applications`. On Linux, this is `/usr`.

## Window Dimensions

### `WINDOW_WIDTH`
The width in pixels of the current Cabbage UI window. This reflects the window size available to the UI and can be used to scale or position widgets.

### `WINDOW_HEIGHT`
The height in pixels of the current Cabbage UI window. Use together with `WINDOW_WIDTH` to determine available drawing area.


## Usage Example

```csound
instr 1
    home:S = chnget("USER_HOME_DIRECTORY")
    desktop:S = chnget("USER_DESKTOP_DIRECTORY")
    prints("Home: %s\n", home)
    prints("Desktop: %s\n", desktop)
endin
```

## Notes

- All paths use forward slashes (`/`) as directory separators, even on Windows
- Empty strings are returned for channels that don't apply to the current platform. For example `WINDOWS_SYSTEM_DIRECTORY` will return an empty string on macOS/Linux. 
- These channels should be treated as read-only and are automatically set by Cabbage at startup
- The actual paths may vary depending on system configuration and user settings
